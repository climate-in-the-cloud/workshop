Adapt the python scripts we used for the tracer concentration to make a movies of the speed and vorticity, profiles of the $x$-velocity, and a time series of the kinetic energy. (You can use different colormaps for the plots of speed and vorticity, e.g. `viridis` for speed and `coolwarm` for vorticity.
